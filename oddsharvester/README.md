> **Umbrella tokens (football):** `over_under` and `asian_handicap` are umbrella market tokens — pass either as `--market` and it expands at scrape time to every line OddsPortal actually renders for that match (e.g. `over_under_1_5_market`, `over_under_2_5_market`, …), instead of listing each line by hand.

> **Cricket:** OddsPortal does not currently publish a per-bookmaker odds table for cricket, so cricket scraping returns match metadata (teams, league, score, result) with an empty odds list. The `home_away` market is wired and will populate if OddsPortal adds cricket odds.

100+ leagues supported across all sports: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, ATP/WTA Grand Slams, and [many more](src/oddsharvester/utils/sport_league_constants.py).

## CLI Usage

OddsHarvester has four commands: **`upcoming`**, **`historic`**, **`live`**, and **`community`**. They share most options, with a few command-specific ones.

### `oddsharvester upcoming`

Scrape odds for upcoming matches — by date, by league, or by specific match URL.

```bash
# By date
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -d 20250301 -m 1x2 --headless

# By league (scrapes all upcoming matches for that league)
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -l england-premier-league -m 1x2,btts --headless

# Multiple leagues
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -l england-premier-league,spain-laliga -m 1x2 --headless

# Specific match URLs (repeat the flag; works for past matches too)
oddsharvester upcoming -s football --match-link "https://www.oddsportal.com/football/..." -m 1x2

# Preview mode (faster — best/highest odds only, no individual bookmakers)
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -d 20250301 -m over_under --preview-only --headless

# Only matches kicking off within the next 6 hours (fewer requests)
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -l england-premier-league -m 1x2 --kickoff-within-hours 6 --headless

# Collect links plus kickoff only (fixture plan; no odds scraped)
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -d 20250301 --links-only -f csv -o upcoming_links.csv
```

### `oddsharvester historic`

Scrape historical odds and results for past seasons.

```bash
# Single league & season
oddsharvester historic -s football -l england-premier-league --season 2022-2023 -m 1x2 --headless

# Current season
oddsharvester historic -s football -l england-premier-league --season current -m 1x2 --headless

# Limit pagination
oddsharvester historic -s football -l england-premier-league --season 2022-2023 -m 1x2 --max-pages 3 --headless

# Output as CSV
oddsharvester historic -s football -l england-premier-league --season 2024-2025 -m 1x2 -f csv -o premier_league_odds --headless

# Umbrella market — expands to every Over/Under line rendered on the page
oddsharvester historic -s football -l england-premier-league --season 2023-2024 --market over_under -f csv
```

### `oddsharvester live`

Take a one-shot snapshot of matches currently in play, with per-bookmaker in-play odds.

```bash
# Every live match for a sport
oddsharvester live -s tennis -m match_winner --headless

# Restricted to one league
oddsharvester live -s football -l england-premier-league -m 1x2 --headless

# Re-sample one known match without reloading the listing
oddsharvester live -s football --match-link "https://www.oddsportal.com/football/..." -m 1x2 --headless

# Collect live match links only
oddsharvester live -s football --links-only -o live_links.json --headless
```

Each record carries the usual match metadata plus live context: `live_period`
(the period marker exactly as the site displays it, so it is sport-specific:
`4'` or `Half-time` in football, `1st Set` in tennis, `9th Inning` in baseball), `live_score_home`,
`live_score_away`, `live_score_raw` (keeps compound formats such as
`0:1 (3:6, 4:2)`), and `scraped_at_utc`, which is what makes a series of
snapshots comparable.

Notes:

- **Zero live matches is a normal outcome**: the command prints a message and
  exits 0 without writing a file.
- **Matches that end between listing and scrape are dropped**, so a snapshot only
  ever contains genuinely live matches.
- **In-play bookmaker coverage is thinner than pre-match** (often 2 to 4
  bookmakers instead of 15 to 20) and varies by region.
- `--odds-history` and `--period` are rejected: the in-play view exposes neither.
- **For repeated sampling, schedule the command externally** (cron or similar).
  Keep at least 60 seconds between snapshots, and prefer `--match-link` to
  re-sample a known match without re-reading the listing. The command itself
  never refreshes a page, which keeps its request profile identical to
  `upcoming`.

### `oddsharvester community`

Scrape OddsPortal Community data. `community` has three mutually-exclusive modes; exactly one is required:

- **Top predictions** (`--sport`): the most-voted community picks for the next 7 days.
- **User profile** (`--user <username>`): a tipster's stats, monthly performance and recent predictions.
- **Match community votes** (`--match-url <url>`): per-market community vote volume for a single match.

#### Top predictions (`--sport`)

```bash
# Top predictions for a sport
oddsharvester community -s football --headless

# Write to a named JSON file
oddsharvester community -s football -f json -o top_predictions.json --headless
```

Each record contains the match (`home_team`, `away_team`, `match_url`, `kickoff`, plus the raw `kickoff_text` label kept as fallback when the date token fails to parse), the league (`sport`, `country`, `league`), the voted `market`, best odds per outcome (`odds`), the community vote split (`community_votes_pct`), and `scraped_at`.

- OddsPortal surfaces ~10 picks per sport (no pagination) with rounded percentages.
- Pre-match only: OddsPortal drops community data from finished-match pages, so build longitudinal datasets by scraping while matches are still upcoming.

#### User profile (`--user <username>`)

```bash
oddsharvester community --user BLAPRO --headless
```

Emits one record: header (`username`, `roi_pct`, `member_since`, `country`, `privacy`), the
monthly `statistics` table (`month`, `total_predictions`, `won`, `lost`, `plus_minus`,
`roi_pct`, incl. a `Total` row), and the rendered `predictions` batch. Each prediction has
`market`, `home_team`/`away_team`, `score` (when finished), and a positional `outcomes` list
of `{odds, community_pct, picked}` plus `pick_odds`. Most profiles are **private**: a private
profile returns the header only (`privacy: "private"`, empty stats/predictions) and exits 0.

#### Match community votes (`--match-url <url>`)

```bash
oddsharvester community --match-url "https://www.oddsportal.com/football/h2h/.../" --headless
```

Emits one record with per-market community vote volume: `markets[]` of `{market, scope,
handicap, betting_type_id, scope_id, total_votes, outcome_counts}`, most-voted first, plus
`top_community_pick`. Pre-match only (OddsPortal drops community data from finished matches).

**Limitations:** `--match-url` outcome vote **counts are unlabeled**: OddsPortal obfuscates the
per-outcome ids, so only per-market volume, the count distribution, and the single aggregate
pick are recoverable. `--user` captures the first rendered predictions batch (no deep
pagination) and does not emit per-prediction win/loss (use the monthly stats table).

### CLI Options Reference

#### Core Options

| Option         | Short | Description                                                                | Default    |
| -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `--sport`      | `-s`  | Sport to scrape (`football`, `tennis`, `basketball`, etc.)                 | _required_ |
| `--date`       | `-d`  | Target date in `YYYYMMDD` format                                           | —          |
| `--league`     | `-l`  | Comma-separated league slugs (e.g. `england-premier-league`)               | —          |
| `--market`     | `-m`  | Comma-separated markets (e.g. `1x2,btts`)                                  | —          |
| `--match-link` |       | Specific match URLs, comma-separated and/or repeated. Skips listing pages; `--date`/`--league`/`--season` are then ignored | —          |
| `--match-links-file` |       | File with match URLs to scrape, one per line. Combines with `--match-link`; duplicates are dropped | —          |

**`--match-link` usage:** `--sport` is still required. Prefer `upcoming` over `historic` for arbitrary match URLs: match links bypass the listing pages entirely, so `upcoming` also works for matches already played, while `historic` would additionally demand a `--season` it never uses. For large link sets (a `--links-only` output, re-running failures), prefer `--match-links-file`: a pasted command line gets silently truncated by the terminal past a few hundred URLs.

**`upcoming` only:** `--date` is required unless `--league` or `--match-link` is provided. `--date` and `--league` can be combined to filter the league's upcoming matches down to a specific calendar day. When combining both, the reference timezone for resolving the date is `--timezone` if provided, otherwise UTC. `--kickoff-within-hours N` keeps only matches starting within `N` hours from now; the filter runs during link collection, so far-off matches are never visited. It pairs with the default upcoming-only behaviour to bound the window on both sides, and uses `--timezone` (else UTC) as the reference clock. Combined with `--links-only`, each row also carries `kickoff_utc`, so a scheduler can plan a day of fixtures from one listing request instead of re-fetching the listing on every cycle.

**`historic` only:**

| Option        | Description                               | Default    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `--season`    | Comma-separated seasons to scrape (`YYYY`, `YYYY-YYYY`, or `current`). Scraped as the cartesian product with `--league`. Duplicates are ignored. | _required_ |
| `--max-pages` | Max number of result pages to scrape. Applies per league/season combo, not per run. | unlimited  |

**`live` only:** no `--date` and no `--season`; the command always reads whatever is in
play at the moment it runs. `--league` accepts **at most one** slug. `--odds-history` and
`--period` are rejected outright, because the in-play view exposes neither. A
`--match-link` given in classic form is normalized to its in-play URL automatically, so
either form works. When every match fails to scrape the command exits non-zero, which is
what lets a scheduled sampler tell a blocked run apart from a genuinely empty one.

#### Output Options

| Option      | Short | Description                                                                | Default        |
| ----------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `--storage` |       | `local` or `remote` (S3)                                                   | `local`        |
| `--format`  | `-f`  | `json` or `csv`                                                            | `json`         |
| `--output`  | `-o`  | Output file path                                                           | `scraped_data` |
| `--append`  |       | Append to the output file instead of overwriting it (`--no-append` to opt out explicitly) | `--no-append`  |
| `--links-only` |       | Collect match links only, without scraping odds (`--no-links-only` to opt out explicitly) | `--no-links-only` |
| `--local-kickoff` |       | Add venue-local kickoff time to each record (`--no-local-kickoff` to opt out explicitly). Distinct from `--timezone` | `--no-local-kickoff` |

> **Breaking change:** every output row now carries a `season` column. For odds
> rows it is inserted directly after `match_date`; `--links-only` rows have no
> `match_date` and carry `season` alongside the other link fields instead. It
> holds the scraped season for `historic` and is empty for `upcoming` and
> `--match-link` runs. Appending to a file produced by an earlier version
> yields a file with two different column layouts, so start a new output file
> rather than appending across the upgrade.

> **Breaking change:** `upcoming --links-only` rows now carry a `kickoff_utc`
> column, appended at the end. Appending to a file produced by an earlier
> version yields a file with two different column layouts, so start a new
> output file rather than appending across the upgrade. `historic` and `live`
> links-only rows are unchanged.

#### Browser & Scraping Options

| Option            | Short | Description                               | Default |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--headless`      |       | Run browser in headless mode              | `False` |
| `--concurrency`   | `-c`  | Concurrent scraping tasks                 | `3`     |
| `--request-delay` |       | Delay (sec) between match requests        | `1.0`   |
| `--user-agent`    |       | Custom browser user agent                 | —       |
| `--locale`        |       | Browser locale (e.g. `fr-BE`)             | —       |
| `--timezone`      |       | Browser timezone (e.g. `Europe/Brussels`) | —       |
| `--base-url`      |       | Scrape a regional OddsPortal mirror instead of `www.oddsportal.com` (e.g. `https://www.centroquote.it`). Page structure is identical; only the domain changes. Regional mirrors may expose a different/larger set of bookmakers. Recommended: pair with `--locale`/`--timezone` matching the region. Env var: `OH_BASE_URL`. | —       |

#### Proxy Options

| Option         | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--proxy-url`  | Proxy URL (`http://...` or `socks5://...`). **Repeatable** — pass it multiple times to rotate per-match scraping round-robin across proxies. Each URL may embed credentials (`scheme://user:pass@host:port`). |
| `--proxy-user` | Proxy username. Applies only when a **single** `--proxy-url` without embedded credentials is given; ignored (with a warning) if multiple proxies are passed.           |
| `--proxy-pass` | Proxy password. Same single-proxy restriction as `--proxy-user`.                                                                                                       |

> **Tip:** For best results, match `--locale` and `--timezone` to your proxy's region.

**Multi-proxy example** — spread scraping across three proxies with embedded credentials:

```bash
oddsharvester historic --sport football --league england-premier-league --season 2013-2014 \
  --market 1x2 --concurrency 6 \
  --proxy-url http://user:pass@p1.example.com:8000 \
  --proxy-url http://user:pass@p2.example.com:8000 \
  --proxy-url http://user:pass@p3.example.com:8000
```

Matches are dispatched round-robin across the proxies; a proxy that fails 3 times in a row (navigation/rate-limit errors) is dropped from rotation and the run continues on the survivors.

#### Advanced Options

| Option               | Description                                            | Default        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `--target-bookmaker` | Filter odds for a specific bookmaker                   | —              |
| `--odds-history`     | Include historical odds movement per match             | `False`        |
| `--odds-format`      | Odds display format                                    | `Decimal Odds` |
| `--preview-only`     | Fast mode — best/highest odds, no bookmaker details    | `False`        |
| `--bookies-filter`   | Bookmaker filter: `all`, `classic`, or `crypto`        | `all`          |
| `--period`           | Match period (sport-specific: full-time, halves, etc.) | sport default  |

<details>
<summary><strong>Preview Mode vs Full Mode</strong></summary>
<br>

| Aspect           | Full Mode                   | Preview Mode                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Speed**        | Slower (interactive)        | Faster (passive)              |
| **Data**         | All submarkets + bookmakers | Visible submarkets + best odds |
| **Bookmakers**   | Individual bookmaker odds   | Best/highest odds only        |
| **Odds History** | Available                   | Not available                 |
| **Structure**    | By bookmaker                | By submarket (best odds)      |

Preview mode (`--preview-only`) is useful for quick exploration, testing data format, or light monitoring with reduced resource usage. It reads the collapsed submarket row — the single best/highest price OddsPortal shows per line, not a per-bookmaker breakdown and not a computed average (see `docs/agentic-gotchas.md` §12).

</details>

### Two-pass workflow: collect links, then scrape

For large runs it can be safer to collect all match links first, then scrape odds per link and re-run only the failures (see issue #75):

```bash
# Pass 1 - collect the season's match links (no odds scraped)
oddsharvester historic -s football -l england-premier-league --season 2022-2023 \
    --links-only -f csv -o links.csv

# Pass 2 - scrape odds from the collected links (--append fills recovered failures)
tail -n +2 links.csv | cut -d, -f1 | sort -u > links.txt
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -m 1x2 -f csv -o odds.csv --append \
    --match-links-file links.txt
```

On `upcoming`, the same pass 1 doubles as a fixture plan: one listing request
returns every match of the day with its kickoff, so a scheduler can decide
offline which matches are close enough to be worth scraping.

```bash
# Plan the day's fixtures: links plus kickoff, no odds scraped
oddsharvester upcoming -s football -d 20260731 --links-only -f csv -o upcoming_links.csv
```

Output rows contain `match_link`, `sport`, `league`, and `season` (`date` and `kickoff_utc` for `upcoming`; `live` emits neither), in the site's listing order. `kickoff_utc` holds the match's own kickoff in UTC, in the same shape as `match_date` (`2026-07-31 18:30:00 UTC`), and is empty when the listing exposes no parseable kickoff. Under the default upcoming-only behaviour that means the date header could not be read, the row had no `time-item` element, or its clock text was not `HH:MM`; with `--include-started`, live rows still come back empty, since their clock is replaced by a period marker; postponed, cancelled, and most finished rows keep the clock instead, giving a populated `kickoff_utc` with the originally scheduled kickoff. Options that only affect odds scraping (`--market`, `--period`, `--odds-history`, `--preview-only`, `--target-bookmaker`, `--bookies-filter`) are ignored when `--links-only` is set. `--links-only` cannot be combined with `--match-link`.

### Bulk scraping: multiple leagues, multiple seasons

`--season` and `--league` both accept comma-separated lists. `historic` scrapes every combination as the cartesian product, sequentially, league outer and season inner, so output stays grouped and deterministic. `--max-pages` applies per combo, not per run.

```bash
# Several seasons of one league
oddsharvester historic --sport football --league england-premier-league \
    --season 2020-2021,2021-2022,2022-2023 --links-only --format csv --output links.csv

# Cartesian product: every league by every season
oddsharvester historic --sport football \
    --league england-premier-league,spain-laliga \
    --season 2021-2022,2022-2023 --links-only

# A league that changed season format mid-history: pass both formats and
# let the invalid pairs report zero
oddsharvester historic --sport football --league russia-premier-league \
    --season 2010,2010-2011,2011,2011-2012 --links-only
```

No pre-filtering is attempted to figure out which `(league, season)` pairs are valid before scraping them; a wrong-format pair (e.g. `2010` for a league that only ever used `2010-2011`) is simply scraped and returns zero links. That is normal, not an error: OddsPortal returns HTTP 200 for a dead season URL, so the only way to tell a valid combo from an invalid one is to scrape it and count the results (see `docs/agentic-gotchas.md` §15). When more than one combo runs, an end-of-run table lists each league/season pair with its count, then reports how many combos returned nothing and how many errored. A zero-count combo does not affect the exit code; only errored combos are worth re-running.

### Local kickoff time

`--local-kickoff` adds two fields to each record: `venue_timezone` (the venue's IANA timezone id) and `match_date_venue_local` (the kickoff converted to that timezone, with an explicit offset), e.g. `2022-05-01 16:00:00 BST+0100`. `match_date` stays UTC; the two fields are additive and only appear when the flag is set.

Resolution is best-effort from the record's venue country/town. Single-timezone countries resolve by country; USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, and Australia resolve by host city instead. A venue that can't be resolved gets `null` for both fields.

Not compatible with `--links-only` (no match pages are visited, so there's no venue to resolve). Distinct from `--timezone`, which sets the browser's context timezone and does not affect the output fields.

If you `--append` onto an existing CSV file, the header is frozen on the first write, so start a fresh file when you turn the flag on.

### Blocked odds

OddsPortal strikes through a price when that bookmaker has stopped offering the bet. Each per-bookmaker odds record then carries a `blocked_outcomes` field listing which outcomes are struck through, using the same labels as the odds themselves:

```json
{
  "bookmaker_name": "Unibet.fr",
  "1": "1.32",
  "X": "4.55",
  "2": "6.10",
  "blocked_outcomes": ["1", "X", "2"]
}
```

The labels are the market's own, so they differ per market: `1` / `X` / `2` for 1X2, `odds_over` / `odds_under` for Over/Under, and so on.

The field is always collected, with no flag to enable, and is **omitted entirely when nothing is blocked**, so records for available odds are unchanged. Odds values are kept exactly as rendered: a struck-through price is still the last price that bookmaker showed. A bookmaker with no price at all renders `-` and is not flagged, so "no odds" and "blocked" stay distinguishable.
