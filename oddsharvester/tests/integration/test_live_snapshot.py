"""Integration tests for the live (in-play) snapshot flow.

Two complementary tests:

- A deterministic HAR replay of a real live football match, captured while it was
  in play on 2026-07-20. A live page is ephemeral, so once a match ends its
  in-play view is gone for good: the HAR is the only way this flow can ever be
  replayed. Runs by default, no network.
- A self-discovering live-network test that scrapes whatever is in play right now
  and skips when nothing is. Marked live_only, run with --live.

Both drive the CLI as a subprocess, like the other integration tests, which also
covers the real user-facing path.
