"""Integration tests for cricket scraping.

Unlike every other sport, OddsPortal does NOT expose a per-bookmaker odds table on
cricket match-detail pages. Cricket detail pages render "No odds available for this
match" and their `home_away_market` comes back empty, even for marquee internationals
(verified on England vs India, One Day International) and even through a non-France
proxy. The listing pages show aggregate teaser odds only. See docs/agentic-gotchas.md.

So this test is the inverse of the other sports' regression guards: it asserts that
cricket scraping extracts match metadata correctly end-to-end (teams, league,
structure) AND that `home_away_market` is empty, which is the real, current OddsPortal
behavior. It guards the cricket wiring (a parsing regression would corrupt the metadata
or crash) without asserting odds that the source does not provide.

The fixture + HAR were captured via a non-France proxy (OddsPortal geo-hides cricket
listings from France; the detail odds are absent from every region). Refresh with:

    uv run python -m tests.integration.helpers.capture --sport cricket \
        --league one-day-international \
        --match-url "https://www.oddsportal.com/cricket/h2h/england-UJC5mtAU/india-fcOzl2uI/" \
        --markets "home_away" --period "full_including_ot" \
        --bookies-filter "all" --season current --capture-har --proxy-url http://<proxy>
