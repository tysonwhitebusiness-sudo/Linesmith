"""
League season aliases for leagues that changed sponsor names.

Some leagues on OddsPortal change their URL slug when sponsors change.
For example, Czech Republic's top league was "fortuna-liga" until 2023-2024,
then became "chance-liga" from 2024-2025 onwards.

This module provides a mapping to resolve the correct URL slug for a given season.
